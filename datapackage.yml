            Data source used to determine borehole location. The addition "guess" indicates that the location could not be well corroborated against a published plot.

            - published: Coordinates published in original publication
            - digitized from plot: Coordinates could be retrieved by digitizing a location plot and its axes
            - from metadata: Coordinates were provided as metadata with data submission
            - web map service approximation: Through comparison against a published plot, coordinates could be easily approximated using e.g., google maps, caltopo etc.
