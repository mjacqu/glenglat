Subject: Glacier temperatures from 1970s

Dear Bobbie Winter-Burke,

I am a researcher at the Department of Geography at the University of Zurich, and a maintainer of the global database of glacier temperature measurements (https://github.com/mjacqu/glenglat). During a literature search, we found that the following paper mentions temperature measurements made at Storglaciären (a glacier in Sweden) in 1978.

> Hooke, R., Gould, J. E., & Brzozowski, J. (1983). Near-surface temperatures near and below the equilibrium line on polar and subpolar glaciers. Zeitschrift Für Gletchserkunde Und Glazialgeologie, 19(1), 1–25.
  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roger-Hooke/publication/316560947_Near-surface_temperatures_near_and_below_the_equilibrium_line_on_polar_and_subpolar_glaciers/links/599dd4e145851574f4b357bc/Near-surface-temperatures-near-and-below-the-equilibrium-line-on-polar-and-subpolar-glaciers.pdf

Which in turn references:

> Gould, John E. A survey of the summer ice temperature distribution of Storglaciären, N. Sweden. Unpublished manuscript dated 1978 available from University of Bristol, Department of Geography or from University of Stockholm

Colleagues at U. of Stockholm / Tarfala Research Station found a hand-written manuscript that partly matches the description, but it is missing the most important data: the temperature measurements to ~25 m depth in the borehole drilled at stake #15, which presumably continued from 1978 until 1981. The manuscript references another which they have not found:

> Gould J.E. (1978) Temperature measurements on Storglaciären

John E. Gould was presumably a student (bachelor or master?) at the University of Bristol's Department of Geography at the time, so perhaps some of this material is archived in your library as unpublished and not-yet-indexed-online manuscripts or theses?

thank you for your time and all the best,
ethan

Subject: Fw: Glacier temperatures from 1970s - long shot!!

Hi Ethan,

Good news. I have managed to locate a copy of my undergraduate thesis (attached).

> Gould, John E. A survey of the summer ice temperature distribution of Storglaciären, N. Sweden. Unpublished manuscript dated 1978

Refer to your original email request at the bottom of this rather lengthy email thread to view your original request..

It was stored in my late parents loft for most of the past 47 years! I have had it scanned along with my article "Arctic Summer" in the 1978 Brycgstowe Vol.14 p23-26 (Brycgstowe is the Univ of Bristol, Geographical Society, Magazine)

Luckily I was in the UK when this request came through as I normally reside in New Zealand and the papers in the attic!

Although some significant cost was involved in getting the attached scans, I am happy to make this contribution to the important work of the World Glacier Monitoring Service.

Finally, thanks are due to all those copied into this email for helping to make the retrieval of this potentially important data possible.

Keep up the good work.
Warm regards,
John Gould
