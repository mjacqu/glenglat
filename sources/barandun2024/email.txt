Hi Ethan and Mylene,

Sorry I am a bit confused about what to correct now. I added the second profile but only for one year. The reason is that we have some issues with depth adjustment and therefore I did not initially send it. The temperatures however do barely change over time, so that I think its best just to send one. I hope that s fine.

For the 422 borehole there was a mistake in calibration adjustment and the depth from surface. I corrected also for this now. Sorry for that. Now the data should be correct. I corrected everything just on the Data.xlsx file. Is that ok or do you want me to also adjust the other files?

Best,
Martina
