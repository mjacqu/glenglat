Hi Mylène,

I apologise it has taken me a while, but I have managed to compile our measurements together into the attached Excel spreadsheet.

There are 91 measurements in total, of which 21 are already in your database. These are marked in orange with the field “New” set to False. The 70 new measurements have new ID values increasing from 1000.

I have tried to adhere to database guidelines as much as possible although the profile times are all in Swiss time. I can try to covert them to UTC but this would a bit complex due to daylight saving and the past irregularity to Central European Time.

Please let me know if you would like me to make any changes.

Many thanks,
Marcus

Hi Marcus,

Many thanks for compiling these data! At first glance it looks great. I have a few questions – partly related to the fact that we've started keeping track of a few new variables that we are trying to populate whenever we have the information.

For instance, we have added a column to keep track of whether the measurements are in firn, ice, or both.

--> Do you happen to which (if any) of the boreholes reached into the ice?

We've also tried to track the drilling vs measurement times. I see that you have included a DateTime in the borehole tab. Are these drilling times or measurement times? I ask because I noticed some discrepancies between the different dates (e.g., the Date column in the borehole tab reads 1991-08-07 00:00, but the measurement tab shows 1991-08-04. Does this mean that the date included in the measurement tab is the drilling time, the time in the borehole tab is the measurement time, or how is this organized?

In the measurement tab, if the time is indicated as 00:00 does this mean that the temperatures were actually measured at midnight or does it mean that the precise measurement time is not known (i.e., only the date)?

Finally, for boreholes that have the same coordinates (e.g., 1014 and 1016), do you know whether the borehole was re-drilled, or was the same thermistor chain read out on two different dates? I ask because we try to make a distinction between repeat measurements that are made in the same borehole vs repeat measurements that are re-drilled at the same (or rather very similar) location.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

Mylène

Hi Mylène,

Of course, I’ll try and answer your questions as best as I can.

I presume most of the shallow profiles (<30 metres) are probably still retained within the firn, with the deeper ones reaching the ice. I would have to check this with my colleagues though.

The date/time in the borehole tab are the measurement times. The five left hand columns on that sheet were really just for my convenience as I used an XLOOKUP function to match the dates and switch between our ID numbers and yours. But I do have access to the drilling times as well which I could add to the spreadsheet.

With regard to the 00:00 times, I also noticed this after I sent the document. I believe these are likely missing values where the time wasn’t recorded but let me check with Martin Hoelzle.

Yes, this is demarcated in the labelling convention where you have “XX YY-I/yy i” where ‘XX’ is the borehole location (either CG – Colle Gnifetti, SJ – Seserjoch or GG – Lower Grenzgletscher), ‘YY’ is the borehole drilling year, ‘I’ is the borehole identifier, ‘yy’ is the measurement year and ‘i’ is the measurement number.

for example:

CG95-1/96  - borehole 1 drilled in 1995 (CG95-1), (single) measurement in 1996.
CG95-1/97A - borehole 1 drilled in 1995 (CG95-1), first measurement in 1997.
CG95-1/97B - borehole 1 drilled in 1995 (CG95-1), second measurement in 1997.

In some instances, new boreholes were drilled in the same position as old ones, but these became inaccessible over time due to closure.

Finally, I was speaking with Martin Hoelzle yesterday and he was saying he recommended also including the sensor product name and its calibration technique into the database. I can provide this information as well.

If you let me know how you would like this information placed in the spreadsheets (i.e. field/column names and allowable entries) , I can update the spreadsheet accordingly and sent it back to you soon.

Many thanks,
Marcus

Hi Marcus,

[...]

If you could give us an estimate at which ice is expected at Colle Gnifetti or indicate in the borehole table which boreholes reached the ice, this would by ideal!

Where you have the information for both measurement and drilling, it would be great if you could add these. My suggestion would be that you put the drilling date into the borehole table (borehole.date) and the measurement time into the measurement table (measurement.date_min and measurement.date_max, plus the time if available. If 00:00 means that the measurement time is not known, you can just leave these fields empty.

> ‘YY’ is the borehole drilling year, ‘I’ is the borehole identifier, ‘yy’ is the measurement year and ‘i’ is the measurement number.

This is helpful, thank you. In cases where the borehole ID (label) is the same (e.g., CG03-1) but the coordinates are slightly different, does this mean that the borehole was re-drilled in approximately the same location? Do you have an explicit record of when a borehole was redrilled or do you simply have the labels? The background is that we would like to indicate when measurements were done in the same borehole by assigning them the same borehole-id. If all you have are the labels, then you can simply leave the information as is in the spreadsheet and we will group them as is. If you want to / have additional information, it would be great if you could indicate which ones were made in the same borehole, and when a borehole was re-drilled (e.g., by assigning some grouping-ID or so). Does this make sense?

> Finally, I was speaking with Martin Hoelzle yesterday and he was saying he recommended also including the sensor product name and its calibration technique into the database. I can provide this information as well.

We don't currently have a specific field for this, but you may add this to the notes, and we can add it in that way.

> If you let me know how you would like this information placed in the spreadsheets (i.e. field/column names and allowable entries), I can update the spreadsheet accordingly and sent it back to you soon.

I noticed that the DOIs in lines 74-83 are not working, I think there is a missing _ and number at the end? Can you investigate?

If you could update the spreadsheet in the suggested ways, that would be really helpful. Many thanks for you help with this!

Hi Mylène,

Please find attached the updated spreadsheet [Grenzgletscher Boreholes.xlsx].

Drilling and measurement times have been added, the DOI hyperlink has been corrected and estimates of whether the measurement reaches the ice have also added. I’ve also merged repeat measurements together to have the same ID number if they are in the same borehole. If the co-ordinates are similar but the borehole IDs are different, they are redrillings.

For example, the CG82-1 borehole has a single measurement CG82-1/82 in 1982 under existing ID 273. The CG18-1 borehole was drilled in the exact same place in 2018 with seven measurements between 2018 and 2023 all under ID 1047, marked CG18-1/18, CG18-1/19 etc.

Hello Ethan,

Please find attached the updated spreadsheet.

I’ve updated all identification numbers to match the database and corrected previous mistakes. All measurements within this spreadsheet are contained within your spreadsheet, except a repeat measurement for the CG77-1 borehole in 1978 (id 1 – label CG77-1/78), that I’ve highlighted in orange on the measurements tab.

I’ve added some additional information regarding all funding sources for both the drilling and measurement of boreholes, as well as added any missing references.

Do let me know if any changes are required.

Many thanks,
Marcus

Hi Marcus,

Thank you for this revised submission.

> All measurements within this spreadsheet are contained within your spreadsheet, except a repeat measurement for the CG77-1 borehole in 1978 (id 1 – label CG77-1/78), that I’ve highlighted in orange on the measurements tab.

This profile was already present in glenglat (borehole-profile 1-2), as we had digitized it from Figure 2 in Blatter & Haeberli 1984. Are your numbers the result of a similar procedure, or really pulled from a more original data source?

Rereading Haeberli 1991, I believe that both your submission and glenglat made the same mistake. Two boreholes were drilled 1 m apart in 1977, and I'm pretty sure that the 1977 profile from Haberli 1991 is from the first 50 m borehole (later filled with snow), and the 1978 profile from Blatter & Haeberli 1984 is from the second 65 m borehole. i.e. We have CG77-1/77 and CG77-2/78, not CG77-1/77 and 78. Would you agree?

Then, very minor, but it seems like there are still some differences with the times reported in the cryomap database that Mylène found on the VAW servers (and which I put here for your reference: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KIuz_hGwGeR4WDcziQWmrtthFzKvcJ6rYxUMhIicRsw). These 1994 boreholes have times in this dataset but don't in your submission:

GG94-0/94 (1994-06-02) – 07:30:00
GG94-1/94A (1994-06-01) – 08:00:00
GG94-1/94B (1994-09-07) – 08:30:00
GG94-2/94A (1994-06-01) – 20:00:00
GG94-2/94B (1994-09-05) – 17:00:00
GG94-3/94A (1994-06-01) – 15:07:00
GG94-3/94B (1994-09-06) – 12:40:00
GG94-4/94 (1994-05-31) – 17:50:00
GG94-A/94 (1994-10-31) – 13:00:00
GG94-B/94 (1994-10-31) – 15:00:00

And then one discrepancy for the time of the following profile. Note that 19:10:00 is the time in both sources for the GG99-15/99 profile reported immediately above, so maybe a copy-paste error in your submission? 1999-07-15 19:10 is also the same date and time reported for GG99-22/99 in both sources, so unlikely to also be the time of this borehole.
LJ99-16/99 (1999-07-15) – 18:00:00 (cryomap) vs. 19:10:00 (your submission)

Hi Marcus,
(email 2 of 2)

I now had a chance to compare your submission more carefully to our database, and found a few deviations. I've listed them here: https://github.com/mjacqu/glenglat/issues/93

Most are quite minor and mostly missing borehole attributes for us to fill in. But there are a few that suggest an error on your side, so I wanted to report these for your own data-compilation efforts. These are the ones listed with a dot instead of a checkbox.

My one question is regarding the submitted temperature_uncertainty of 561 (CG08-1), which is 1.5. This borehole was not listed in your revised uncertainties table, but I presume that this very high uncertainty is a result of your reanalysis?

Hello Ethan,

Thanks for all your hard work checking over the submission.

In many cases they are small mistakes on my part that I have corrected in the attached version [Monte Rosa Boreholes.xlsx], although there are a few that I think need to be corrected in glenglat.

Hopefully, this closes all discrepancies between the database and my submission.

Cheers,
Marcus

Details below: [SUBMISSION] mistake in my submission that is now corrected ¦ [GLENGLAT] possible mistake in glenglat that needs to be corrected ¦ [INFO] additional information / question response]

> This profile was already present in glenglat (borehole-profile 1-2), as we had digitized it from Figure 2 in Blatter & Haeberli 1984. Are your numbers the result of a similar procedure, or really pulled from a more original data source?

SUBMISSION: No, this is your digitised version I acquired back in summer. I mistakenly assumed it was a new measurement because of the labelling mistake (see next point) and because I think it seems you have since updated the values, so they no longer match.

> Rereading Haeberli 1991, I believe that both your submission and glenglat made the same mistake. Two boreholes were drilled 1 m apart in 1977, and I'm pretty sure that the 1977 profile from Haberli 1991 is from the first 50 m borehole (later filled with snow), and the 1978 profile from Blatter & Haeberli 1984 is from the second 65 m borehole. i.e. We have CG77-1/77 and CG77-2/78, not CG77-1/77 and 78. Would you agree?

[SUBMISSION] Yes, you are completely correct – it should be CG77-1/77 and CG77-2/78.
[GLENGLAT] Provisionally assigned borehole CG77-2 the new ID number 783 – correct as appropriate depending on glenglat update.
[INFO] I have copied the same coordinates as CG77-1 as I am not entirely sure in which direction the metre offset is – I haven’t been able to find this info in the literature.

> Then, very minor, but it seems like there are still some differences with the times reported in the cryomap database that Mylène found on the VAW servers [see above].

[SUBMISSION] Yes, these are all the correct times. I’m not sure why they were missing but I shall put them back.

> LJ99-16/99 (1999-07-15) – 18:00:00 (cryomap) vs. 19:10:00 (your submission)

[SUBMISSION] Yes, that’s an Excel drag mistake on my part. 18:00:00 is the correct time.

[...]

> My one question is regarding the submitted temperature uncertainty of 561 (CG08-1), which is 1.5. This borehole was not listed in your revised uncertainties table, but I presume that this very high uncertainty is a result of your reanalysis?

[SUBMISSION] Yes, I had not mentioned it in my previous submission because we had sort of discarded it as a bad measurement. I also hadn’t mentioned the CG19-1 borehole in my last submission because this is only a shallow depth thermistor chain contained above the depth of Zero Annual Amplitude (ZAA). It was a continuously logging (12-hour interval) chain designed to investigate annual/seasonal temperature variation near the surface.

I think the first 25 metres were drilled in May but then it was extended to 40 metres in August. Still the measurements only reach 25 metres due to water issue. It also states that temperatures were logged between 2000-08-24 to 2000-08-26. Incorrect in both glenglat and our database.
