Dear Ethan,

I just thought I’d let you know that I’ve been withholding sending you the [revised] submission, because I've been questioning the validity of the measurements taken during 2008 and 2013 – some of which are in fact already contained within your database. These are for new steam-drilled boreholes, where the measurement has been taken shortly afterwards and the thermistor temperatures are not fully equilibrated. The values have subsequently been adjusted using a linear thermal dissipation adjustment according to Suter et al. (2002) https://doi.org/10.3189/172756402781817059 but due to the short measurement time there is a very high uncertainty. Recorded deep firn temperatures from these measurements are much warmer than present day observations and those prior to 2000 and therefore appear anomalous in the long-term trend of englacial warming. This is the reason that I investigated the matter further and it hasn’t been as apparent in the past.

Many thanks,
Marcus

Dear Ethan,

[...]

I have had a few discussions with Martin Hoelzle regarding these problematic profiles and I provide a table of estimated uncertainties below. As my PhD topic will revolve around further analysing englacial warming at Colle Gnifetti, I will be trying to improve these measurements - particulary those at the saddle point of Colle Gnifetti. (CG08-2/08 and CG13-2/13). I will let you know if I can provide improved values for these measurements in the future. But hopefully these estimates will suffice for the time being.

Please note that this uncertainty value represents that of the least equilibrated thermistor below a depth of 10 metres - as you mentioned those near the surface are quite susceptible to greater fluctuation. At least in my own research, these are generally of lesser importance as I am interested in tracking warming beyond the depth of seasonal variance.

I have calculated these values to a single decimal place, by adjusting the range of values in the regression calculation used by Suter. I.e. choosing less data points towards the end of the measurement typically provides a lower final temperature but with a less reliable extrapolation. Of the 12 profiles, 7 have a particulary poor extrapolation leading to high uncertainty.

*Note: these values are specifically negative as opposed to the standard ± in conventional absolute uncertainty values. As these are pre-equilibrated temperatures where the thermistor is cooling from warmer conditions at the surface or the effects of the borehole steam drilling, Martin and I consider the temperature value provided to be more of an upper bound.

Kind Regards,
Marcus
