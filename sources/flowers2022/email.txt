Hi Mylène,

[...]

This batch is just for one site where we have a single temperature cable that did not reach the bed but documents temperate ice over ~200m of the ice column (see pdf). Boring. I have a lot more metadata on this, some of which I've included in the comments. The most important is probably that the accuracy of each sensor is no better than +/- 0.2 C.

Let me know if there is anything that makes these data unusable for you.

Next, onto "North" and "South" Glaciers where the temperatures are more interesting...

Best,
Gwenn

Hi again Mylène,

Attached are spreadsheets for data from two more of our pet glaciers in Yukon. These are the data you have seen in Wilson et al (2013): https://agupubs-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/doi/full/10.1002/jgrf.20096 so should be easier to make sense of given the documentation.

Please let me know if you have questions, and if there is anything that would inhibit the use of these data in your project or by others.

Thanks again,
Gwenn
