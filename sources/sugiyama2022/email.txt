Dear Mylène,
c.c. Paco

I am writing to submit our ice temperature data for the database that you announced. The temperature was obtained at Johnsons Glacier on Livingston Island situated near Antarctic Peninsula. The requested information is summarized in the attachment file. Please tell me if you have a question on the data.

Thank you for setting up an interesting and important database.

All the best,
Shin
