Binary files with `.png` or `.pdf` extensions are figures, tables, maps, or text from the publication. Text files with an `.xml` extension document how numeric values were extracted from maps and figures using PlotDigitizer (https://plotdigitizer.sourceforge.net). Of these, digitized temperature profiles are named `{source_id}_{borehole_id}_{profile_id}.xml` and internally use `temperature` and `depth` as axis names.
