    description: Sources of information considered in the compilation of this database. Column names and categorical values closely follow the Citation Style Language (CSL) 1.0.2 specification. Names of people in non-Latin scripts are followed by a latinization in square brackets (e.g. В. С. Загороднов [V. S. Zagorodnov]) and non-English titles are followed by a translation in square brackets. The family name of Latin-script names is wrapped in curly braces when it is not the last word of the name (e.g. Emmanuel {Le Meur}, e.g. {Duan} Keqin) or the name ends in two or more unabbreviated words (e.g. Jon Ove {Hagen}). The family name of a Chinese name (and of the latinization) is wrapped in curly braces when it is not the first character.
